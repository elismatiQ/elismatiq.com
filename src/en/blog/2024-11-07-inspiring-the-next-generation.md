## Introduction

Imagine a room filled with the boundless energy and limitless potential of 70 Black high school students, all curious to learn about the thrilling world of cybersecurity. That's exactly the scene that unfolded at the 2nd annual CSE-CST Career Day 2024 in Ottawa, where I had the honour of speaking and engaging this extraordinary group of young minds. As they hung on my every word, I couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement for the future of this dynamic field.

## Diversity in Cybersecurity: A Pressing Challenge

The cybersecurity industry has long grappled with a severe lack of diversity, particularly when it comes to racial representation. According to a 2021 (ISC)<sup>2</sup> Cybersecurity Workforce Study, a mere 9% of cybersecurity professionals globally identified as Black. In Canada, the situation is similarly dire, with visible minorities still underrepresented in the tech sector, including cybersecurity.

## Empowering the Next Generation with Inspiring Role Models

But at the CSE Career Day, the tide was turning. The highlight of the event was the appearance of Caroline Xavier, the highest-ranking Black individual in the Canadian public service. As the CEO of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Caroline's presence was a testament to the power of representation and the impact that a single inspiring role model can have.

- Caroline's background as the daughter of Haitian immigrants🇭🇹 and her rise to this prestigious position served as a powerful inspiration for the young attendees.
- Students eagerly approached Caroline, snapping selfies and asking her about her remarkable journey, fuelling their own dreams of success.
- Caroline's infectious energy and enthusiasm, coupled with her rolling cart filled with Halloween candies, created a truly memorable and engaging experience for the students.

## Sparking Curiosity and Competition

I had the chance to interact with the students directly and it was such a magical moment for me. I challenged them with a series of thought-provoking questions about cybersecurity, AI, and coding, offering coveted prizes like Viola Desmond bills ($10 CAD) and Hidden Figures books to the winners.

- The students' responses showcased a good understanding of these cutting-edge technologies and a genuine passion for shaping the digital future.
- By connecting the cybersecurity field to broader themes of diversity and representation, we were able to inspire and empower these young minds.

## Investing in Canada's Cybersecurity Future

The CSE Career Day event reflects the organization's commitment to diversity and inclusion, aligning with the Canadian government's broader efforts to strengthen the country's cybersecurity workforce and promote inclusivity in the tech sector.

- Canada has been steadily increasing its focus on cybersecurity education, with the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security offering a range of resources and programs to students and educators.
- Events like the CSE Career Day are crucial for sparking early interest in cybersecurity and addressing the global shortage of skilled professionals in this field. A big thank you to the affinity groups at CSE, the Ottawa Catholic School Board, and every individual and volunteer who dedicated their time to make this event possible

## Conclusion: Empowering the Next Generation of Cybersecurity Leaders

As I left the CSE Career Day, I couldn't help but feel a sense of hope and optimism for the future. These young Black students, armed with newfound knowledge and the inspiration of role models like Caroline Xavier, are poised to become the cybersecurity trailblazers of tomorrow.

By investing in diversity, engaging youth, and fostering a culture of innovation and inclusion, the CSE and the broader Canadian government are paving the way for a more secure and equitable digital future. The future of cybersecurity has never looked brighter, and it's all thanks to the boundless potential of these extraordinary young minds.
