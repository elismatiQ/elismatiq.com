I recently had the incredible opportunity to be a panelist at the [3rd Annual Federal Black Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Conference 2024](https://acbncanada.com/federal-black-entrepreneurship-ecosystem-conference-2024/), where the focus was on "**Practical Uses and Strategies of AI to Accelerate Your Business**". The panel, held on <time datetime="2024-10-29">October 29th</time>, was an amazing experience, and I'm excited to share some of the key insights and discussions that emerged.

## The Power of AI for Growth and Equity

The panel, moderated by **Israel Ebite**, brought together a diverse group of experts, including [Claudius Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudius-thomas-4b186321), [Dr. Adegboyega Ojo](https://carleton.ca/sppa/people/ojo-adegboyega/), [Edwina McKennon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinamckennon/), and myself, [David Elisma](https://www.linkedin.com/company/elismatiq). We explored a range of practical questions about how small businesses, particularly Black-owned businesses, can leverage AI to improve efficiency, overcome challenges, and stay competitive.

We discussed how AI tools can be used to enhance customer experiences, build stronger relationships with clients, and even level the playing field in industries dominated by large corporations. It was particularly inspiring to see the enthusiasm and interest from the attendees, many of whom had innovative ideas about how they could use AI to transform their businesses.

## Ethical Considerations: A Crucial Focus

One of the key points that one of the panelists, Edwina McKennon, emphasized during the discussion was the importance of ethical considerations when implementing AI solutions. While AI offers tremendous potential, it's crucial to ensure its application is fair, transparent, and aligned with our community values. This is especially important for Black entrepreneurs, as our businesses are often deeply connected to our communities, and we need to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits everyone.

## The Future of AI for Black Entrepreneurs

I was particularly struck by the realization that the Black community is not only curious about AI but also possesses a wealth of knowledge and data that can be invaluable in its application. This was evident in the many attendees who approached me after the panel to discuss their ideas and learn more about how AI can be used to solve real-world problems.

The conversations I had at the conference reinforced my belief that Black entrepreneurs are well-positioned to be leaders in the AI space. We have the creativity, resilience, and community focus to ensure that this powerful technology is used to create a more equitable and prosperous future for all.

## A Call to Action

The Federal Black Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Conference was a powerful reminder of the incredible potential of Black entrepreneurship. It also highlighted the importance of collaboration, innovation, and ethical leadership as we navigate the exciting world of AI. I'm incredibly optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to work with fellow entrepreneurs to harness the power of AI for good.
